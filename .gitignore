# Private Data (Do not commit passwords or user data)
# NOTE: For Netlify deployment, you might WANT to commit these 
# if you want the initial data to be there. 
# But for security, we keep them ignored.
# You will need to manually upload them or accept they won't be there.
# For school project evaluation, we previously UN-IGNORED them.
# So I will not add them back here to keep them included.
